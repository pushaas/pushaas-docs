[PushaaS](https://github.com/pushaas) is a project that aims to offer [server-push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology) functionality as a [service](https://docs.tsuru.io/stable/services/index.html) for the [Tsuru](https://tsuru.io/) PaaS, based on tools built around the [Push Stream](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/modules/push_stream/) module for [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/).

The system that implements the [push service](TODO) can also be deployed manually outside of Tsuru, as a standalone server-push system.

## Components

This project documents all the pieces that compose the PushaaS ecosystem. All projects in the ecosystem can be found at https://github.com/pushaas.
